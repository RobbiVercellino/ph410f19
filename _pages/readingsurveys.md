This page contains past reading surveys. It's just an archive -- these shouldn't be used for turning stuff in or anything.

### Reading Survey 1

Question 1: Have you ever learned about the Dirac delta function in a math or physics class, and could you describe its properties?

Never learned about it; Learned about, can describe; Learned about, can't describe

Question 2: Consider the image of a disk-shaped uniform surface charge density at http://evantilton.com/ph410f19/images/s1-disk.png
Suppose you were asked to find the electric field at point P. According the Griffiths's standard notation, vectors A, B, and C (respectively) should be assigned what names?

r, r', 𝓻; **𝓻, r, r'**; 𝓻, r', r; r', r, 𝓻; r, 𝓻, r'

Question 3: What is the magnitude of the separation vector from source point (2,8,7) to field point (4,6,8)?

10.8; 21.4; -3; **none of the above**

Question 4: What is the gradient of the function f(x,y,z)=x²+y³+z?

x²x̂+y³ŷ+zẑ;2x²x̂+3y³ŷ+zẑ;2xx̂+3yŷ+zẑ;2xx̂+3y²ŷ+zẑ; **2xx̂+3y²ŷ+ẑ**

### Reading Survey 2
What is the result of ∫v⋅dl for vector field v(x,y,z)=2yzŷ along the straight-line path from the origin to (0,1,0)?
-1,0,0.5,1,none of the above

### Reading Survey 3
Consider a volume charge density given by ρ(x,y,z)=aδ(x-1)δ(z) where δ indicates the usual Dirac delta function. The coordinates x, y, and z are position coordinates. Using SI units, what are the units of the constant a? (Hint: What are the units of the Dirac delta?)

C; C/m; C/m²; C/m³; None of the above

Again consider a volume charge density given by ρ(x,y,z)=aδ(x-1)δ(z) where δ indicates the usual Dirac delta function. The coordinates x, y, and z are position coordinates. What physical scenario does this charge density represent?

 A point charge; An infinite line of charge; An infinite plane of charge; An infinite volume of charge
