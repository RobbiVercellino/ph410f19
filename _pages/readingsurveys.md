This page contains past reading surveys. It's just an archive -- these shouldn't be used for turning stuff in or anything.

### Reading Survey 1

Question 1: Have you ever learned about the Dirac delta function in a math or physics class, and could you describe its properties?

Never learned about it; Learned about, can describe; Learned about, can't describe

Question 2: Consider the image of a disk-shaped uniform surface charge density at http://evantilton.com/ph410f19/images/s1-disk.png
Suppose you were asked to find the electric field at point P. According the Griffiths's standard notation, vectors A, B, and C (respectively) should be assigned what names?

r, r', 𝓻; **𝓻, r, r'**; 𝓻, r', r; r', r, 𝓻; r, 𝓻, r'

Question 3: What is the magnitude of the separation vector from source point (2,8,7) to field point (4,6,8)?

10.8; 21.4; -3; **none of the above**

Question 4: What is the gradient of the function f(x,y,z)=x²+y³+z?

x²x̂+y³ŷ+zẑ;2x²x̂+3y³ŷ+zẑ;2xx̂+3yŷ+zẑ;2xx̂+3y²ŷ+zẑ; **2xx̂+3y²ŷ+ẑ**

### Reading Survey 2
What is the result of ∫v⋅dl for vector field v(x,y,z)=2yzŷ along the straight-line path from the origin to (0,1,0)?
-1,**0**,0.5,1,none of the above

### Reading Survey 3
Consider a volume charge density given by ρ(x,y,z)=aδ(x-1)δ(z) where δ indicates the usual Dirac delta function. The coordinates x, y, and z are position coordinates. Using SI units, what are the units of the constant a? (Hint: What are the units of the Dirac delta?)

C; C/m; C/m²; C/m³; None of the above

Again consider a volume charge density given by ρ(x,y,z)=aδ(x-1)δ(z) where δ indicates the usual Dirac delta function. The coordinates x, y, and z are position coordinates. What physical scenario does this charge density represent?

 A point charge; An infinite line of charge; An infinite plane of charge; An infinite volume of charge
 
 ### Reading Survey 4
 
The reading due for Monday was section 2.1 (pp. 59-65). Because practicing problems to test ones understanding is the only way to learn physics confidently, I'm curious what our reading habits currently look like as a class. Did you (or will you) solve any of the (unassigned) problems in Griffiths for this section prior to class time on Monday?

Yes;No;Prefer not to answer

 Suppose two charges, +q and -q, lie on the y axis, positioned symmetrically about the origin. The positive charge lies above the x-axis, while the negative charge lies below the x-axis. In what direction does the electric field point at an arbitrary point A on the x-axis?
 
 +ŷ;**-ŷ**;+x̂;-x̂;Other or not enough info

 ### Reading Survey 5
A thick spherical, with inner radius a and outer radius b, carries charge density ρ=k/r². What is the electric field interior to the shell (i.e., at r<a)?

**0**; nonzero, pointed radially out; nonzero, pointed radially in; none of the above


Look at Griffiths Problem 2.16, part iii. It asks you to find the electric field outside a coaxial cable under a particular set of circumstances. What is the electric field in the specified region?

**0**;nonzero, pointed radially; nonzero, pointed along cable; none of the above

 ### Reading Survey 6

You have a thin spherical shell of uniform positive charge +Q centered at the origin with no other charge anywhere (i.e. all the charge is concentrated in a hollow shell at r=R). If we decide to define V(∞)=0, what is the sign of V(0)?
**positive**; negative; zero; it depends

For the same physical scenario described in the previous question, could we instead choose to define V(R)=0?

**Yes**;No;It depends

For the same physical scenario described in the previous questions, what is the sign of  (V(r=R) – V(r=0))?

Positive;**Negative**;Zero;It depends

### Reading Survey 7

Three identical charges +q sit on an equilateral triangle with side of length a. The triangle of charges is isolated from the rest of the universe. If you released one of the three charges while keeping the other two fixed, what would be the final kinetic energy of the released charge? (The variable k is the Coulomb constant.)
