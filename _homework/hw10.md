consider a long magnetic rod, radius a.  This time imagine that we can set up a permanent azimuthal magnetization M(s,z) =  , with c=constant, and s is the usual cylindrical radial coordinate.  Neglect end effects, assume the cylinder is infinitely long.
Calculate the bound currents b and Jb (on the surface, and interior of the rod respectively).  What are the units of "c"? Use these bound currents to find the magnetic field B, and also the H field, inside and outside. (Direction and magnitude)
