Law of cosines: $\mathfrak{r}^2=r^2+{r^\prime}^2=2rr^\prime \cos\theta^\prime=r^2\left(1+\frac{{r^\prime}^2}{r^2}-\frac{2r^\prime}{r}\cos\theta^\prime\right)$
  
If $\epsilon\equiv r^\prime/r$:
$$\mathfrak{r}=r\sqrt{1-2\epsilon\cos\theta^\prime+\epsilon^2}$$
$$\frac{1}{\mathfrak{r}}=\frac{1}{r}\left(1-2\epsilon\cos\theta^\prime+\epsilon^2\right)^{1/2}$$

E) None of these, or more than one of these!

(For any which you did not select, how DO they behave at large r?)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E (Both C and D)

In terms of the multipole expansion $V(r) = V(mono) + V(dip) + V(quad) + \dots$, the following charge distribution has the form:

![alt text](../images/d22-multipole_charge_configs_3.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. $V(r) = V(mono) + V(dip) +\;$ higher order terms
2. $V(r) = V(dip) +\;$ higher order terms
3. $V(r) = V(dip)$
4. $V(r) =\;$ only higher order terms than dipole
5. No higher terms, $V(r) = 0$ for this one.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D

Which of the following distributions could have a dipole contribution to the potential far from the charges?

![alt text](../images/d22-distributionA.png "Logo Title Text 1")
![alt text](../images/d22-distributionB.png "Logo Title Text 1")
![alt text](../images/d22-distributionC.png "Logo Title Text 1")

D. None

E. More than one!

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* We didn't specify where the origin!

<section data-markdown>

In which situation is the dipole term the leading non-zero contribution to the potential?

![alt text](../images/d22-multipole_charge_configs_4.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. 1 and 3
2. 2 and 4
3. only 5
4. 1 and 5
5. Some other combo

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D


</section>

<section data-markdown>

Consider a single point charge at the origin. It will have ONLY a monopole contribution to the potential at a location $\mathbf{r} = \langle x,y,z\rangle$.

As we have seen, if we move the charge to another location (e.g., $\mathbf{r}' = \langle 0,0,d \rangle$), the distribution now has a dipole contribution to the potential at $\mathbf{r}$!

What the hell is going on here?

1. It's just how the math works out. Nothing has changed physically at $\mathbf{r}$.
2. There is something different about the field at $\mathbf{r}$ and the potential is showing us that.
3. I'm not sure how to resolve this problem.

<section data-markdown>

A VERY thin slab of thickness $d$ and area $A$ has volume charge density $\rho = Q / V$. Because it's so thin, we may think of it as a surface charge density $\sigma = Q / A$.

![alt text](../images/d23-thin_slab_polarization.png "Logo Title Text 1")

The relation between $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is:
1. $\sigma = \rho$
2. $\sigma = \rho d$
3. $\sigma = \rho/d$
4. $\sigma = V \rho$
5. $\sigma = \rho/V$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
