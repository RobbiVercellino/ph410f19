A certain fluid has a velocity field given by $\mathbf{v} = x\hat{x} + z \hat{y}$. Which component(s) of the field contributed to "fluid flux" integral ($\int_S \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$) through the x-z plane?

1. $v_x$
2. $v_y$
3. both
4. neither

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Only the vector perpendicular to the surface will contribute

A certain fluid has a velocity field given by $\mathbf{v} = x\hat{x} + z \hat{y}$. If we intend to calculate the "fluid flux" integral ($\int_S \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$) through the x-z plane, what is $d\mathbf{A}$ in this case? Be specific!

1. $dxdy\hat{y}$
2. $dxdz\hat{y}$
3. $dxdz\hat{z}$
4. $dydz\hat{z}$
4. It's none of these

For the same fluid with velocity field given by $\mathbf{v} = x\hat{x} + z \hat{y}$. What is the value of the "fluid flux" integral ($\int_S \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$) through the entire x-y plane?

1. It is zero
2. It is something finite
3. It is infinite
4. I can't tell without doing the integral

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* The velocity field is parallel to the x-y plane every where and hence contributes no flux through the surface.

A rod (radius $R$) with a hole (radius $r$) drilled down its entire length $L$ has a mass density of $\frac{\rho_0\phi}{\phi_0}$ (where $\phi$ is the normal polar coordinate).

To find the total mass of this rod, which coordinate system should be used (take note that the mass density varies as a function of angle):

1. Cartesian ($x,y,z$)
2. Spherical ($r,\phi,\theta$)
3. Cylindrical ($s, \phi, z$)
4. It doesn't matter, just pick one.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
* It makes the most sense from the geometry of the problem and writing the limits.

What is the divergence in the boxed region?

<img src ="./images/pt_charge_red_box.png" align="right" style="width: 400px";/>

1. Zero
2. Not zero
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Lines in; lines out - harder to see dE/dx and dE/dy
* One of those curious ones where the 2D picture might get in the way; think 3D

Consider a vector field defined as the gradient of some well-behaved scalar function:
$$\mathbf{v}(x,y,z) = \nabla T(x,y,z).$$

What is the value of $\oint_C \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$?

1. Zero
2. Non-zero, but finite
3. Can't tell without a function for $T$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Closed loop integral of a gradient is zero.
