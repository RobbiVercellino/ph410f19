An electric current $I$ flows along a copper wire (low resistivity) into a resistor made of carbon (high resistivity) then back into another copper wire. In which material is the electric field largest?

1. In the copper wire
2. In the carbon resistor
3. It's the same in both copper and carbon
4. It depends on the sizes of the copper and carbon

Note:
* Correct Answer: D, normally B, but it will depend on the relative sizes (if the wire gets really small!)

A loop of wire is near a long straight wire which is carrying a large current $I$, which is **decreasing**.  The loop and the straight wire are in the same plane and are positioned as shown.  The current induced in the loop is:

1. counter-clockwise
2. clockwise
3. zero.
