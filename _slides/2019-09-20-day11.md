#DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT
### PH410 - Electromagnetism

September 20
<!--this doesn't work... {% include spotifyplaylist.html id=page.spotifyplaylist %}-->
</section>

<section data-markdown>
On slack while we wait...  The potential is zero at some point in space.

You can conclude that:
1. The E-field is zero at that point
2. The E-field is non-zero at that point
3. You can conclude nothing at all about the E-field at that point

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

### For Monday
- Griffiths Section ??
- Reading survey

HW posted tomorrow, due next Friday 
	
</section>




<section data-markdown>

The potential is constant everywhere in some region of space.

You can conclude that:
1. The E-field has a constant magnitude in that space.
2. The E-field is zero in that space.
3. You can conclude nothing at all about the magnitude of $\mathbf{E}$ along that line.

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

<section data-markdown>

We are trying to compute the the electric potential $V(\mathbf{r})$ for a line of charge at the location $\langle x,0,z \rangle$. What is $|\mathfrak{R}|$ in this case?

1. $x$
2. $z$
3. $\sqrt{x^2+z^2}$
4. Something else

Note: Correct Answer D (needs to have z')

</section>

<section data-markdown>

We derived the potential for this short rod to be

$V(x,z) = \dfrac{\lambda}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\log\left[\dfrac{L+z+\sqrt{x^2+(L+z)^2}}{L-z+\sqrt{x^2+(L-z)^2}}\right]$

The associated electric field at $\langle x,0,z\rangle$ location can have the following components:

1. only x
2. only y
3. only z
4. x, y, and z
5. Something else

A spherical *shell* has a uniform positive charge density on its surface. (There are no other charges around.)

What is the electric field *inside* the sphere?
1. $\mathbf{E}=0$ everywhere inside
2. $\mathbf{E}$ is non-zero everywhere in the sphere
3. $\mathbf{E}=0$ only that the very center, but non-zero elsewhere inside the sphere.
4. Not enough information given

Note:
* Correct Answer: A
</section>

<section data-markdown>

We derived the electric potential outside ($r>R$) the charged shell to be

$$V(r) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\dfrac{q}{r}$$

What is it for $r<R$?

1. Zero
2. Constant
3. It changes but I don't know how yet
4. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

<section data-markdown>

![alt text](../images/d10-graph_shell.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Could this be a plot of $\left|\mathbf{E}(r)\right|$? Or $V(r)$? (for SOME physical situation?)

1. Could be $E(r)$, or $V(r)$
2. Could be $E(r)$, but can't be $V(r)$
3. Can't be $E(r)$, could be $V(r)$
4. Can't be either

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
