## Gauss's law in integral form...

$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\frac{Q_{\rm enc}}{\epsilon_0}$

## ...plus divergence theorem...

$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\int_V\left( \nabla\cdot \mathbf{E}\right) d\tau$

## ...Gauss's law in differential form

$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}=\rho/\epsilon_0$


</section>

<section data-markdown>

What is the divergence in the boxed region?

![alt text](../images/d3-divredbox.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. Zero
2. Not zero
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Lines in; lines out - harder to see dE/dx and dE/dy
* One of those curious ones where the 2D picture might get in the way; think 3D

</section>

<section data-markdown>

We have shown twice that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ using what seem to be appropriate vector identities. But physically, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/ \varepsilon_0$. What is going on?!


</section>



<section data-markdown>

#### Div of $\mathbf{E}$ contains Guass's Law. What about curl?
Know $\mathbf{E}(\vec{r})=\int_V \frac{\rho(\vec{r^\prime})d\tau^\prime}{|\mathfrak{r}|^2}\hat{\mathfrak{r}}$.

Also, from HW1:
- $\nabla\times\nabla f=0$
- $\nabla\frac{1}{|\mathfrak{r}|}=-\frac{\hat{\mathfrak{r}}}{|\mathfrak{r}|^2}$

## Electric Potential

![alt text](../images/d9-lightning.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

</section>

<section data-markdown>

If $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0$, then $\oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} =$

1. 0
2. something finite
3. $\infty$
4. Can't tell without knowing $C$

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

</section>

<section data-markdown>

Can superposition be applied to electric potential, $V$?

$$V_{tot} \stackrel{?}{=} \sum_i V_i = V_1 +V_2 + V_3 + \dots$$

1. Yes
2. No
3. Sometimes

Note:
* Correct answer: A (usually)
As long as the zero potential is the same for all measurements.

</section>

<section data-markdown>

The potential is zero at some point in space.

You can conclude that:
1. The E-field is zero at that point
2. The E-field is non-zero at that point
3. You can conclude nothing at all about the E-field at that point

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

</section>

<section data-markdown>

The potential is constant everywhere along in some region of space.

You can conclude that:
1. The E-field has a constant magnitude in that space.
2. The E-field is zero in that space.
3. You can conclude nothing at all about the magnitude of $\mathbf{E}$ along that line.

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
