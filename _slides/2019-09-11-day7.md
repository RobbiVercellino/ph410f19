### For Friday
- no reading
- HW2 due

### Tutorials

Work together as necessary, but make sure you're thinking through everything, not just copying.

### Because of superposition, to find $\vec{E}$ we can:

- Start from Coulomb's Law: $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})=k\int\frac{1}{\left|\mathfrak{r}\right|^2}\hat{\mathfrak{r}}dq$
- Express $dq \rightarrow \lambda~dl' \sim \sigma da' \sim \rho d\tau'$
- Compute the integral in convenient coordinates

We obtained:
$$ADD DISK EQN HERE$$


If we are *far from the disk*, what is the small parameter in our Taylor expansion?

1. $x$
2. $a$
3. $x/a$
4. $a/x$
5. More than one of these

Note: Correct answer is D, but this is about a discussion about dimensionless parameters - small compared to what!

If we are *close to the disk*, what is the small parameter in our Taylor expansion?

1. $x$
2. $a$
3. $x/a$
4. $a/x$
5. More than one of these

Note: Correct answer is C, but this is about a discussion about dimensionless parameters - small compared to what!

<section data-markdown>

Which of the following are vectors?

(I) Electric field, (II) Electric flux, and/or (III) Electric charge

1. I only
2. I and II only
3. I and III only
4. II and III only
5. I, II, and II

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

Given the location of the little bit of charge ($dq$), what is $|\vec{\mathfrak{R}}|$?

![alt text](../images/d7-sphereintegrate.png "Logo Title Text 1")


1. $\sqrt{z^2+r'^2}$
2. $\sqrt{z^2+r'^2-2zr'\cos\theta}$
3. $\sqrt{z^2+r'^2+2zr'\cos\theta}$
4. Something else

Note:
CORRECT ANSWER: B

## Gauss' Law

![alt text](../images/d7-gauss_pt_charge.png "Logo Title Text 1")

$$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_V \dfrac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}d\tau$$

The space in and around a cubical box (edge length $L$) is filled with a constant uniform electric field, $\mathbf{E} = E_0 \hat{y}$. What is the TOTAL electric flux $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ through this closed surface?

1. 0
2. $E_0L^2$
3. $2E_0L^2$
4. $6E_0L^2$
5. We don't know $\rho(r)$, so can't answer.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* All the incoming flux on the left side comes out the right side

A positive point charge $+q$ is placed outside a closed cylindrical surface as shown.  The closed surface consists of the flat end caps (labeled A and B) and the curved side surface (C). What is the sign of the electric flux through surface C?

![alt text](../images/d7-ABC_cylinder.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. positive
2. negative
3. zero
4. not enough information given to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* This is meant to be hard to visualize, next slide illustrates it better.

Let's get a better look at the side view.

1. positive
2. negative
3. zero
4. not enough information given to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Some of the incoming flux through C goes out A and B.

What is the divergence in the boxed region?

![alt text](../images/d3-divredbox.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. Zero
2. Not zero
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Lines in; lines out - harder to see dE/dx and dE/dy
* One of those curious ones where the 2D picture might get in the way; think 3D

<section data-markdown>

We have shown twice that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ using what seem to be appropriate vector identities. But physically, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/ \varepsilon_0$. What is going on?!
