- Homework 1 due

<section data-markdown>
A point charge ($q$) is located at position $\mathbf{R}$, as shown. What is $\rho(\mathbf{r})$, the charge density in all space?

![alt text](../images/d4-pt_charge_at_R.png "Logo Title Text 1")


1. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{R})$
2. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{r})$
3. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{r})$
4. $\rho(\mathbf{r}) = q\delta^3(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R})$
5. Something else??

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* This one is a curious one because a delta function is always positive, both C and D are correct.
* Expect most everyone to pick C

What are the units of $\delta (x)$ if $x$ is measured in meters?

1. $\delta(x)$ is dimension less (‘no units’)
2. [$\mathrm{m}$]:      Unit of length
3. [$\mathrm{m}^2$]:    Unit of length squared
4. [$\mathrm{m}^{-1}$]:   1 / (unit of length)
5. [$\mathrm{m}^{-2}$]:   1 / (unit of length squared)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* Think about what the integral must produce.

What are the units of $\delta^3(\mathbf{r})$ if the components of $\mathbf{r}$ are measured in meters?

1. [$\mathrm{m}$]:      Unit of length
2. [$\mathrm{m}^2$]:    Unit of length squared
3. [$\mathrm{m}^{-1}$]:   1 / (unit of length)
4. [$\mathrm{m}^{-2}$]:   1 / (unit of length squared)
5. None of these.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* Should be m^-3

What is the divergence in the boxed region?

![alt text](../images/d3-divredbox.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. Zero
2. Not zero
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Just a check back in.

We have shown twice that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ using what seem to be appropriate vector identities. But physically, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/ \varepsilon_0$. What is going on?!

1. We broke physics - let's call it a day
2. There's some trick to get out of this and that makes me uncomfortable
3. I can see what we need to do
4. ???
