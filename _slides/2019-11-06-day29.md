<section data-markdown>

To find the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at P due to a current-carrying wire we use the Biot-Savart law,
$$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})  = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi}I\int \dfrac{d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\mathfrak{R}}}{\mathfrak{R}^2}$$
In the figure, with $d\mathbf{l}$ shown, which purple vector best represents $\mathfrak{R}$?

Stoke's Theorem says that for a surface $S$ bounded by a perimeter $L$, any vector field $\mathbf{B}$ obeys:

![alt text](../images/d29-balloon_surface.png "Logo Title Text 1")

$$\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{B}) \cdot dA = \oint_L \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

Does Stoke's Theorem apply for any surface $S$ bounded by a perimeter $L$, even this balloon-shaped surface $S$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Sometimes

Much like Gauss's Law, Ampere's Law is always true (for magnetostatics), but only useful when there's sufficient symmetry to "pull B out" of the integral.

So we need to build an argument for what $\mathbf{B}$ looks like and what it can depend on.

For the case of an infinitely long wire, can $\mathbf{B}$ point radially (i.e., in the $\hat{s}$ direction)?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* It violates Gauss's Law for B

Continuing to build an argument for what $\mathbf{B}$ looks like and what it can depend on.

For the case of an infinitely long wire, can $\mathbf{B}$ depend on $z$ or $\phi$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* By symmetry it cannot

Finalizing the argument for what $\mathbf{B}$ looks like and what it can depend on.

For the case of an infinitely long wire, can $\mathbf{B}$ have a $\hat{z}$ component?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Biot-Savart suggests it cannot

<section data-markdown>

For the infinite wire, we argued that $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = B(s)\hat{\phi}$. For the case of an infinitely long **thick** wire of radius $a$, is this functional form still correct? Inside and outside the wire?

1. Yes
2. Only inside the wire ($s<a$)
3. Only outside the wire ($s>a$)
4. No

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
