To find the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at P due to a current-carrying wire we use the Biot-Savart law,
$$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})  = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi}I\int \dfrac{d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\mathfrak{R}}}{\mathfrak{R}^2}$$
In the figure, with $d\mathbf{l}$ shown, which purple vector best represents $\mathfrak{R}$?
