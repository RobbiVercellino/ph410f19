### Electrostatic Potential Energy

</section>

<section data-markdown>

Consider slowly moving a positive charge from a location of low electric potential to one of high electric potential. What is the sign of the work done by you ($W_u$)? What is the sign of the work done by electric field ($W_f$)?

1. $W_u < 0$; $W_f > 0$
2. $W_u < 0$; $W_f < 0$
3. $W_u > 0$; $W_f > 0$
4. $W_u > 0$; $W_f < 0$

Note: Correct Answer is D; Draw field

Three identical charges $+q$ sit on an equilateral triangle. What would be the final $KE$ of the top charge if you released it (keeping the other two fixed)?

1. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{q^2}{a}$
2. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{2q^2}{3a}$
3. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{2q^2}{a}$
4. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{3q^2}{a}$
5. Other

Note:
CORRECT ANSWER: C

Three identical charges $+q$ sit on an equilateral triangle. What would be the final $KE$ of the top charge if you released *all three*?

1. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{q^2}{a}$
2. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{2q^2}{3a}$
3. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{2q^2}{a}$
4. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{3q^2}{a}$
5. Other

Note:
CORRECT ANSWER: A

Does system energy "superpose"?

That is, if you have one system of charges with total stored energy $W_1$, and a second charge distribution with $W_2$...if you superpose these charge distributions, is the total energy of the new system simply $W_1 + W_2$?

1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Draw 4 charges and show that it is not the sum of the 2 charges and the other 2.

Two charges, $+q$ and $-q$, are a distance $r$ apart.  As the charges are slowly moved together, the total field energy

$$\dfrac{\varepsilon_0}{2}\int E^2 d\tau$$

1. increases
2. decreases
3. remains constant

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Consider when they overlap, field goes to zero, must be E gets smaller as they get closer. same volume

![alt text](../images/d11-capacitor_pull_apart.png "Logo Title Text 1")


A parallel-plate capacitor has $+Q$ on one plate, $-Q$ on the other.  The plates are isolated so the charge $Q$ cannot change.  As the plates are pulled apart, the total electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor:

1. increases
2. decreases
3. remains constant.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Same E; constant; larger volume where it is non-zero
