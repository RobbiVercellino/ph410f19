SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) is where quarks (including the charm
quark), and the tauon (like a heavier electron) were discovered.

Note: Charged particles are accelerated inside a long metal cylindrical pipe, which is 2 miles long and has a radius R = 6 cm. All the air is pumped out of this pipe, known as the "beam line."

<section data-markdown>

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. It is $q/\varepsilon_0$.
2. We know what it is, but it is NOT $q/\varepsilon_0$.
3. Need more info/details to figure it out.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

<section data-markdown>

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. Can we use Gauss's Law ($\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$) to find $|\mathbf{E}|$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Maybe?

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

![alt text](../images/d8-dipole_gauss.png "Logo Title Text 1")


An electric dipole ($+q$ and $–q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero *everywhere* on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero...

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about Q enclosed; what can we say about E though? 
USED IN:  Spring 2013 (Pollock) 
LECTURE NUMBER:  5 (Gauss’ Law)
STUDENT RESPONSES:  12, [[84]], 2,2, 0  Sp ’13 (preclass question) 
INSTRUCTOR NOTES This was the “review’ question to start class. Most remembered Gauss law (which was on the board) to vote for A or B, but the debate was about whether the fact that the integral vanishes, does that mean E vanishes EVERYWHERE. It’s so important to understand that knowing the integral doesn’t by itself tell you about the integrand. (There was a lot of discussion, even though the end vote was solid)  -SJP
WRITTEN BY:  Steven Pollock (CU-Boulder) NEW in 2013, combining two older questions.

What is the divergence in the boxed region?

![alt text](../images/d3-divredbox.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. Zero
2. Not zero
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Lines in; lines out - harder to see dE/dx and dE/dy
* One of those curious ones where the 2D picture might get in the way; think 3D

<section data-markdown>

We have shown twice that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ using what seem to be appropriate vector identities. But physically, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/ \varepsilon_0$. What is going on?!

<section data-markdown>

Consider a cube of constant charge density centered at the origin.

**True or False**: I can use Gauss' Law to find the electric field directly above the center of the cube.

1. True and I can argue how we'd do it.
2. True. I'm sure we can, but I don't see how to just yet.
3. False. I'm pretty sure we can't, but I can't say exactly why.
4. False and I can argue why we can't do it.

<section data-markdown>
Consider a spherical Gaussian surface. What is the $d\mathbf{A}$ in $\int\int\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. $r d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
2. $r^2 d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
3. $r \sin \theta d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
4. $r^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: D

<section data-markdown>

Consider an infinite sheet of charge with uniform surface charge density $+\sigma$ lying in the $x-y$ plane. From symmetry arguments, we can argue that $\mathbf{E}(x,y,z)$ can be simplified to:

1. $\mathbf{E}(x,y)$; direction undetermined
2. $E_z(x,y)$
3. $\mathbf{E}(z)$; direction undetermined
4. $E_z(z)$
5. Something else

</section>

<section data-markdown>

We derived that the electric field due to an infinite sheet with charge density $\sigma$ was as follows:

$$\mathbf{E}(z) = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{k} & \mbox{if} & \mbox{ z > 0} \cr \dfrac{-\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{k} & \mbox{if} & \mbox{ z < 0}\end{cases}$$

What does that tell you about the difference in the field when we cross the sheet, $\mathbf{E}(+z)-\mathbf{E}(-z)$?

1. it's zero
2. it's $\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$
3. it's -$\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$
4. it's +$\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0} \hat{k}$
5. it's -$\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0} \hat{k}$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* Makes for a good discussion about cross one direction versus the other

<section data-markdown>

Which of the following two fields has zero curl?

| I | II |
|:-:|:-:|
| <img src ="./images/cq_left_field.png" align="center" style="width: 400px";/> | <img src ="./images/cq_right_field.png" align="center" style="width: 400px";/> |

1. Both do.
2. Only I is zero
3. Only II is zero
4. Neither is zero
5. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
* Think about paddle wheel
* Fall 2016: 9 0 [89] 3 0

What is the curl of the vector field, $\mathbf{v}= c\hat{\phi}$, in the region shown below?

<img src="./images/c_phi_field.png" align="right" style="width: 300px";/>

1. non-zero everywhere
2. zero at some points, non-zero at others
3. zero curl everywhere

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

<section data-markdown>

What is the curl of this vector field, in the red region shown below?

<img src="./images/curl_red_box.png" align="center" style="width: 400px";/>

1. non-zero everywhere in the box
2. non-zero at a limited set of points
3. zero curl everywhere shown
4. we need a formula to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* I think it's D because it depends on how the field drops off, which we haven't indicated. If it's drops off like 1/r, then it has no curl.

1. non-zero everywhere in the box
2. non-zero at a limited set of points
3. zero curl everywhere shown
