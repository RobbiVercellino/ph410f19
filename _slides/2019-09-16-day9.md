On slack while we wait...

An electric dipole ($+q$ and $–q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero *everywhere* on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero...

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about Q enclosed; what can we say about E though? 
USED IN:  Spring 2013 (Pollock) 
LECTURE NUMBER:  5 (Gauss’ Law)
STUDENT RESPONSES:  12, [[84]], 2,2, 0  Sp ’13 (preclass question) 
INSTRUCTOR NOTES This was the “review’ question to start class. Most remembered Gauss law (which was on the board) to vote for A or B, but the debate was about whether the fact that the integral vanishes, does that mean E vanishes EVERYWHERE. It’s so important to understand that knowing the integral doesn’t by itself tell you about the integrand. (There was a lot of discussion, even though the end vote was solid)  -SJP
WRITTEN BY:  Steven Pollock (CU-Boulder) NEW in 2013, combining two older questions.

SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) is where quarks (including the charm
quark), and the tauon (like a heavier electron) were discovered.

Note: Charged particles are accelerated inside a long metal cylindrical pipe, which is 2 miles long and has a radius R = 6 cm. All the air is pumped out of this pipe, known as the "beam line."

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. It is $q/\varepsilon_0$.
2. We know what it is, but it is NOT $q/\varepsilon_0$.
3. Need more info/details to figure it out.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. Can we use Gauss's Law ($\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$) to find $|\mathbf{E}|$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Maybe?

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

## Divergence theorem

$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\int_V\left( \nabla\cdot \mathbf{E}\right) d\tau$

</section>

<section data-markdown>

What is the divergence in the boxed region?

![alt text](../images/d3-divredbox.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. Zero
2. Not zero
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Lines in; lines out - harder to see dE/dx and dE/dy
* One of those curious ones where the 2D picture might get in the way; think 3D

</section>

<section data-markdown>

We have shown twice that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ using what seem to be appropriate vector identities. But physically, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/ \varepsilon_0$. What is going on?!

<section data-markdown>

Consider a cube of constant charge density centered at the origin.

**True or False**: I can use Gauss' Law to find the electric field directly above the center of the cube.

1. True and I can argue how we'd do it.
2. True. I'm sure we can, but I don't see how to just yet.
3. False. I'm pretty sure we can't, but I can't say exactly why.
4. False and I can argue why we can't do it.

<section data-markdown>
Consider a spherical Gaussian surface. What is the $d\mathbf{A}$ in $\int\int\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. $r d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
2. $r^2 d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
3. $r \sin \theta d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
4. $r^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: D

## Electric Potential

</section>

<section data-markdown>

If $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0$, then $\oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} =$

1. 0
2. something finite
3. $\infty$
4. Can't tell without knowing $C$

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

</section>

<section data-markdown>

Can superposition be applied to electric potential, $V$?

$$V_{tot} \stackrel{?}{=} \sum_i V_i = V_1 +V_2 + V_3 + \dots$$

1. Yes
2. No
3. Sometimes

Note:
* Correct answer: A (usually)
As long as the zero potential is the same for all measurements.

</section>

<section data-markdown>

The potential is zero at some point in space.

You can conclude that:
1. The E-field is zero at that point
2. The E-field is non-zero at that point
3. You can conclude nothing at all about the E-field at that point

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

</section>

<section data-markdown>

The potential is constant everywhere along in some region of space.

You can conclude that:
1. The E-field has a constant magnitude in that space.
2. The E-field is zero in that space.
3. You can conclude nothing at all about the magnitude of $\mathbf{E}$ along that line.

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
