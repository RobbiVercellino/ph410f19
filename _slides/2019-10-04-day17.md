### Separation of Variables (Cartesian)

<section data-markdown>

Say you have three functions $f(x)$, $g(y)$, and $h(z)$.
$f(x)$  depends on $x$ but not on $y$ or $z$.
$g(y)$ depends on $y$ but not on $x$ or $z$.
$h(z)$ depends on $z$ but not on $x$ or $y$.

If $f(x) + g(y) + h(z) = 0$ for all $x$, $y$, $z$, then:

1. All three functions are constants (i.e. they do not depend on $x$, $y$, $z$ at all.)
2. At least one of these functions has to be zero everywhere.
3. All of these functions have to be zero everywhere.
4. All three functions have to be linear functions in $x$, $y$, or $z$ respectively (such as $f(x)=ax+b$)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

If our general solution contains the function,

$$X(x) = Ae^{\sqrt{c}x} + Be^{-\sqrt{c}x}$$

What does our solution look like if $c<0$; what about if $c>0$?

1. Exponential; Sinusoidal
2. Sinusoidal; Exponential
3. Both Exponential
4. Both Sinusoidal
5. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
