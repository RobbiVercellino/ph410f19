A + charged particle moving up (speed $v$) enters a region with uniform $\mathbf{B}$ (left) and uniform $\mathbf{E}$ (into page). What's the direction of $\mathbf{F}_{net}$ on the particle, at the instant it enters the region?

![alt text](../images/d27-charge_enters_EandB.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. To the left
2. Into the page
3. Out of the page
4. No net force
5. Not enough information

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* The forces point in opposite directions, but not sure of their size

A wire loop in a $B$ field has a current $I$. The B-field is localized, it's only in the hatched region, roughly zero elsewhere. Which way is $I$ flowing to hold the mass in place?

![alt text](../images/d27-B_holding_mass.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. Clockwise
2. Counter-clockwise
3. You cannot "levitate" like this!

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

A proton (speed $v$) enters a region of uniform $\mathbf{B}$. $v$ makes an angle $\theta$ with $\mathbf{B}$. What is the subsequent path of the proton?

1. Helical
2. Straight line
3. Circular motion, $\perp$ to page. (plane of circle is $\perp$ to $\mathbf{B}$)
4. Circular motion, $\perp$ to page. (plane of circle at angle $\theta$ w.r.t. $\mathbf{B}$)
5. Impossible.  $\mathbf{v}$ should always be $\perp$ to $\mathbf{B}$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

We defined the volume current density in terms of the differential, $\mathbf{J} \equiv \dfrac{d\mathbf{I}}{da_{\perp}}$.

When is it ok to determine the volume current density by taking the ratio of current to cross-sectional area?
$$\mathbf{J} \stackrel{?}{=} \dfrac{\mathbf{I}}{A}$$

1. Never
2. Always
3. $I$ is uniform
4. $I$ is uniform and $A$ is $\perp$ to $I$
5. None of these

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D

3. $K = I/4a$
4. $K = aI$
5. None of the above

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
